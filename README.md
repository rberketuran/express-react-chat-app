This project is mainly based on a YouTube tutorial by Burak Orkmez (As a Programmer).

I have developed all the server side functionalities (all routes, controllers, authentication, jwt verification and socket.io) and made adjustments to match it with the tutorial.
The frontend part, with all React components, hooks and Tailwind CSS, is completely taken from the tutorial.
